              LunarSol event, looming on the horizon, was set to challenge
              everything…

              In 2034, Sotham was on the brink of a revolution, thanks to a
              promising startup named LunarSol. With CityTechs comprehensive
              coverage, the citys anticipation reached fever pitch. Hailed as
              the dawn of a new digital finance era by CTNN, LunarSol was poised
              to redefine the cryptocurrency landscape with its innovative
              blockchain technology. The city, captivated by the promise of a
              brighter future, watched as LunarSol was celebrated as the beacon
              of tomorrows currency.<br></br>
              <br></br>Yet, this promised future dimmed abruptly. LunarSol, in a
              shocking turn of events, orchestrated a rug pull that saw over $10
              billion of investor capital vanish. This betrayal didnt just break
              Sothams trust; it altered the citys course, sending shockwaves
              through every household glued to CTNN.<br></br>
              <br></br>The aftermath was swift and severe. As the city grappled
              with the news, a palpable wave of disbelief and distress swept
              across its populace. Amidst the turmoil, a previously unknown
              affliction emerged – Autism, a stark byproduct of LunarSols
              deceit. This condition, marked by a profound financial shock,
              leads to dramatically altering an individuals behavior and mental
              state. It manifests in a series of acute symptoms: uncontrollable
              dribbling, a sharp decline in social skills, uncontrollable
              revengeful thoughts, and a propensity for making irrational
              decisions.<br></br>
              <br></br>Despite Sothams strides towards recovery, the legacy of
              LunarSols treachery remains indelible, casting a long shadow over
              the city. The architects of this deception are still at large,
              leaving behind not just financial devastation but the rise of
              Autism, a constant reminder of the fragility of trust in the face
              of innovation…

            <h2 className="about_header">Glen Timpson</h2>
            <p className="about_p">
              Glens life before the LunarSol debacle was emblematic of Sothams
              blue-collar grit combined with the digital ages dreams. In a city
              renowned for pioneering the blockchain frontier, Glen found his
              place among those who kept its wheels turning. By day, he
              navigated the physical toil of manual labor, a testament to the
              citys industrial backbone. By night, he immersed himself in the
              virtual gold rush of cryptocurrency, his eyes glued to the
              flickering lights of CityTech News Network (CTNN), the heartbeat
              of Sothams crypto pulse.<br></br>
              <br></br>Despite his modest earnings, Glen was a diligent saver,
              each dollar earmarked with purpose. A portion of his hard-earned
              money always found its way into the latest crypto ventures. Glen
              was no speculator; he approached his investments with the same
              blue-collar work ethic that guided his life—researched, reasoned,
              but always with a hint of hope that one of these digital seeds
              would bloom into the financial windfall he dreamt of.<br></br>
              <br></br>Sotham, with its electric blend of innovation and
              opportunity, fueled Glens aspirations. Here, in the Silicon Valley
              of cryptocurrency, every new coin, every ICO, felt like a shot at
              transcending his current existence. CTNNs constant stream of
              updates, breakthroughs, and expert analyses was more than just
              information for Glen, it was a source of hope. He wasnt alone in
              his quest; the city thrummed with the collective ambition of
              thousands like him, each chasing their slice of the digital
              Valhalla.<br></br>
              <br></br>Yet, for all his dreams and disciplined investments,
              Glens life remained firmly rooted in the reality of his
              blue-collar world. It was a life of balance, straddling the line
              between the tangible sweat of his daily labor and the intangible
              flicker of digital currencies that lit up his portfolio. The
              promise of blockchain was a beacon of hope in Glens life, a light
              that promised a bridge from his present to a future filled with
              possibility.<br></br>
              <br></br>The LunarSol event wasnt just a catastrophe; it was Glens
              personal apocalypse. Swept up in the FOMO surrounding LunarSols
              promising venture, Glen had invested all his savings, both digital
              and fiat, into what he believed was the opportunity of a lifetime.
              He watched in disbelief as everything vanished in the deceitful
              rug pull. This betrayal didnt just empty his wallet; it plunged
              him into an unknown darkness…

            <p className="about_p">
              In the aftermath, Glen found himself lost in a fog he couldnt
              explain. The world seemed to shift under his feet, leaving him
              disoriented and isolated. Symptoms emerged that were foreign and
              unsettling—uncontrollable drooling and a mind clouded with
              vengeance. At the time, no one realised that these were the
              manifestations of Autism.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              Glens struggle was silent and solitary. Without understanding what
              was happening to him, he faced each day with a growing sense of
              detachment from the world he once navigated with confidence. The
              city of Sotham slowly moved on, but for Glen, time seemed to stand
              still, caught in the grip of a condition that had yet to be named.

              Caught in the grip of a condition that had yet to be named, Glen
              faced each day with a growing sense of detachment. The city of
              Sotham, vibrant and relentless, moved on around him. Yet, in the
              solitude of his struggle, a change was brewing—a change that would
              redefine his existence and the city itself.<br></br>
              <br></br>One day, amidst the clutter of his small apartment, Glen
              stumbled upon a makeshift Halloween costume—a superhero outfit he
              had cobbled together years ago. Something about the costume
              stirred a distant part of him. Without a plan or clear reasoning,
              he decided to don the costume. Looking in the mirror, he said one
              simple word that would alter the future of Sotham: “Botman.”
              Leaving Glen behind, Botman ventured out, cloaked in his new
              identity. He was unaware that he wasnt alone in his struggle. The
              city whispered tales of others who, like Botman, were still
              ensnared by Autisms grip. Some found themselves on paths parallel
              to Botmans, donning their own masks of resilience.
